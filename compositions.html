<h2 class="title">Doug McConnell: Selected Choral Works</h2>

	<ul class="works clearfix">
		<li class="boxes first">Pied Beauty (2014)

			<p class='info' id='first' data-stuff="first">SATB Chorus, Solo French Horn, piano.  Commissioned by Dr. Gary Packwood, Director of Choral Activities, for the Mississippi State University Chorale.  This setting of a famous poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins is a lively celebration of God the Creator. The French horn  part is  featured prominently throughout the work, and is playable by a college-level performer.</p>
		</li>


		<li class="boxes second">Great Spirit Come…… (2012)

			<p class='info' id='second'>From The Trinity Suite, for trumpet/flugelhorn and organ. This movement, taken from a larger three-movement suite, can be performed as a single work. It features the use of choral voices who are asked to perform in various groupings within the audience. The size of the choir may vary, from 20 voices (recommended minimum) to a larger group of singers. Two vocal soloists are also used, and are placed in various places in the performance space.  Light percussion (2 – 4 triangle players) are also involved. The movement uses prominent motives from the traditional Southern hymn tune Prospect, with choral text taken from the traditional hymn, The Lone Wild Bird.</p>
		</li> 

		<li class="boxes third">Lord, Make Me An Instrument (2011)
		
			<p class='info' id='third'>SATB Chorus, piano. Written for a choral composition competition, one which solicited new choral settings of the famous Prayer to St. Francis text. It did not win the competition, but you may benefit from sponsoring a premiere performance! This setting uses the ancient Phrygian mode as a point of departure. </p>
		</li>
		<li class="boxes fourth">Hope is the Thing with Feathers (2010) and
		A Little East of Jordan (2010)

			<p class='info' id='fourth'>SATB Chorus, piano. Commissioned by Dr. Stanley Wold, Music Director, The Arrowhead Chorale, Duluth Minnesota. Premiere performances on three subscription concerts, March 2010.
			Texts by Emily Dickinson.</p> 
		
			<p class='info' id='fourth1'>Hope is the Thing with Feathers captures the Ms. Dickinson’s gentle musings on the nature of hope itself. Both the choral parts and the piano incorporate melodic fragments from the traditional Irish folk tune, Slane, which some audiences associate with the hymn text Lord of All Hopefulness, as well as Be Thou My Vision.</p> 

			<p class='info' id='fourth2'>A Little East of Jordan is a more lively and rambunctious rendering of a Dickinson text, one that tells the story of Jacob wrestling with God. This is the latest of several choral pieces that I have written that chronicle various “encounters with God.” (See Elijah and the Raven, Zaccahaeus, below for additional examples).</p>
		</li>

		<li class="boxes fifth">Elijah and the Raven (2008)

			<p class='info' id='fifth'>SATB chorus, a cappella.  Commissioned by Dr. Grant Cook III, for the Heidelberg Concert Choir, for their European tour, Spring, 2008. This challenging work for advanced singers is based on a poem by Heidelberg University poet Dr. William Reyer. The poem is inspired by various texts from the Old Testament, describing Elijah’s ascent to meet with the face of the great “I Am.” The musical setting builds on a succession of lush harmonies, leading to a powerful climax.</p>
		</li>

		<li class="boxes sixth">O God Our Help in Ages Past (2007)

			<p class='info' id='sixth'>SATB chorus, a cappella. Written for and dedicated to the Heidelberg College-Community Chorus, this setting uses each of the stanzas associated with this famous hymn tune to create a series of variations.</p>
		</li>

		<li class="boxes seventh">Set Me as a Seal (2004)

			<p class='info' id='seventh'>SATB chorus, a cappella, with solo flute. Premiered by the College-Community Chorus, Heidelberg College, April 2004.  Subsequent performance by the Heidelberg Concert Choir, 2005 Spring tour. This piece is a new version of work that was originally written for soprano and flute.  Cast in a simple ternary form, the piece features the use of a famous text from the Song of Solomon, one that reminds the reader of the power of love, a force that is as “strong as death.”</p>
		</li>

		<li class="boxes eighth">Zacchaeus (2001) and No Room (2001)

			<p class='info' id='eighth'>SATB chorus, a cappella.  No Room also features a tenor soloist. Both pieces were written during the same year, each one based on a poem by the English hymn writer Fred Pratt Green. Each one was premiered by a different choral ens	emble.</p>

			<p class='info' id='eighth1'>Zacchaeus tells the story of the encounter between Zaccaheus and Jesus Christ, as told in the New Testament. The musical setting, objective at times, but bold in others, builds harmonic tension as the encounter between these two men nears. The final section reflects on the coming death of Christ. Melodic fragments from the Lenten hymn, What Wondrous Love is This? are used as musical commentary as the piece concludes.  Premiered by the Heidelberg Concert Choir, commissioned by Dr. Grant Cook III, with performances on tour,  including a regional ACDA conference.</p>

			<p class='info' id='eighth2'>No Room: “There’s no room on the ark for donkeys!”  This statement is refuted in Green’s powerful poem, reminding the reader that there is room on the ark for such an animal, and also room for the humblest of servants to serve God. The musical setting uses a jazz/blues format at times to underline the humor of the text, but also the important Lenten message that is presented in the second half of the work. This piece was premiered by the Lancaster Chorale in 2003.</p>
		</li>

		<li class="boxes ninth">Nu sculon herigean (1999)

			<p class='info' id='ninth'>SATB Chorus, soprano solo, organ. Commissioned by Tamara Makdad Albrecht and  St. Bede’s Episcopal Church, Atlanta, GA, for their organ dedication concert.  Premiere: March 2000.  This work uses the text for Caedmon’s Hymn, an ancient hymn of praise to God the Creator. The setting uses the original Old English language, which is largely presented by the solo soprano. The choral parts function as a modern English “translation” of the older text. The English hymn tune Deo Gracias is used throughout the anthem as a commentary. The tune appears in fragments throughout most of the work, with one complete presentation of the tune at the anthem’s climax.</p>
		</li>

		<li class="boxes tenth">Psalm 103 (Bless the Lord, O my Soul) (1998)

			<p class='info' id='tenth'>SATB chorus, a cappella. Commissioned by the Mississippi Music Teachers Association for their annual state convention. The premiere performance was provided by the Millsaps Chamber Singers, Dr. Timothy Coker, director.  This setting uses three movements to set the well-known text from the Book of Psalms. There is considerable use of divisi to provide the work’s Neo-Romantic flavor; a work for advanced college singers.</p>
		</li>

		<li class="boxes eleventh">A Message from Paul (1997)

			<p class='info' id='eleventh'>Double-chorus, a cappella. Commissioned by John Williams, Director of Choral Activities, Waldorf College, Forest City, Iowa. 1998. Recorded on the choir’s 1998 CD release.  This challenging work for double chorus is based on a famous text from the Book of Colossions from the New Testament,  a favorite text of director John Williams, one of my mentors.</p>
		</li>

		<li class="boxes twelfth">Look to this Day! (1987)

			<p class='info' id='twelfth'>SATB Chorus, piano. The text is attributed to Kalidasa, a poet/dramatist from ca. 400 B.C.E., urging the reader to look to the future with anticipation. Written for a select group of singers from Princeton High School in Cincinnati Ohio, the setting employs a number of rhythmic and metrical challenges in providing a lively setting of the poem.</p>
		</li>

		<li class="boxes thirteenth">Monotone (1983)

			<p class='info' id='thirteenth'>SATB Chorus, piano. This short work, cast in a ternary form, is based on a simple but striking poem by Carl Sandburg, one that extols the beauty that the “monotone” that the rain provides, before moving on to other noteworthy images. The music uses a somewhat Impressionistic musical style, one that relies on repetition and simplicity.</p>
