		<p class="hero-text"><em>"If it is art, it is not for all. And if it is for all, it is not art."</em><br>-Arnold Schoenberg
 		<p class="welcome">This provocative statement from Arnold Schoenberg has some truth to share. At the same time, worrying about whether one can create art and what this means is dangerous territory. Kurt Weill once said that he didn't care very much about posterity. He has a good point; have the courage to write what you believe in and accept the consequences from there.</p>

		<p class="welcome">I want to compose music that satisfies my own creative interests: if I don't like what I hear, how can I expect anyone else to do the same? Beyond that, I  believe in a model called the composer-as servant, one who writes music for a larger and more general audience. This route still leaves plenty of room for challenge, either in the composing of a given work, or in its presentation, as some of the people who have presented my music will tell you!  My thanks to the wonderful teachers, mentors and musicians who have enriched my life and made the works listed on this website a reality.</p>
