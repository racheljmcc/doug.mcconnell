            <p class="logo-text">The main site logo is a sketch originally made by the developer of this website, Rachel J. McConnell. It was used as advertisement for a concert featuring compositions of Doug McConnell.</p>

             <p class="logo-text">The university was very inclined to help advertise if they could charge admission for the concert. Some work being featured used text that required copyright permission. The permission was for arrangement, adaotion, performance - but not a charged performance. Once this was discovered, financial support was withdrawn. The composer still needed to advertise for the concert and so borrowed an image from his oldest daughter's sketchbook. As one of his colleagues said, "It looks more like you than you do!"  Doesn't it?</p>
